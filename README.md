# white-box-adversarial-attacks

This repository contains the code required to replicate the results presented in the paper "Adversarial Attack for Deep Learning Based IoT Appliance Classification Techniques"

Place the .npy files in the "data" folder in an appropriate folder. The "data" folder was too big to be uploaded on GitHub, so please follow the link in the paper to get the data.

The Jupyter Notebooks in the "code" folder need changes in only two places in each Notebook.
They need the new path of wherever the .npy files are stored. These locations have comments indicating the same.
